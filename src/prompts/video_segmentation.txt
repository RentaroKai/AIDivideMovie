# Video Event Segmentation by Audio-Declared IDs

## Task Description
Analyze this video and segment it based on event IDs that are verbally announced in the audio track. Extract all event IDs along with their corresponding timestamps.

## Output Requirements
Return all detected event IDs with their start and end timestamps in CSV format.

## Output Format
```csv
event_id,start_time,end_time
E01,00:01,00:12
E02,00:14,00:22
E03,00:25,00:45
```

## Instructions
1. Listen carefully to the entire audio track
2. Identify each verbally announced event ID
3. Note the exact timestamp when each event begins
4. Determine when each event ends (either at the start of the next event or at video end)
5. Format timestamps as MM:SS or HH:MM:SS as appropriate
6. List events in chronological order

## Example Event ID Patterns
- "Event E01"
- "ID: E02"
- "Starting event E03"
- Other verbal declarations of event identifiers
